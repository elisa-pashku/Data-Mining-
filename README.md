DATASET: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance
          Predict attrition of your valuable employees


Tasks of the project:

1.Data Understanding: Explore the dataset with the analytical tools studied and write a concise “data understanding” report describing data semantics, 
                      assessing data quality, the distribution of the variables and the pairwise correlations. 
2.Clustering analysis: Explore the dataset using various clustering techniques. Carefully describe  decisions for each algorithm and which are the advantages 
                        provided by the different approaches. 
3.Classification: Explore the dataset using classification trees to predict the target variable. 
4.Association Rules: Explore the dataset using frequent pattern mining and association rules extraction to predict a variable either for replacing missing 
                      values or to predict target variable.
